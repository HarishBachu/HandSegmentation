# HandSegmentation
A new project Im starting. This is a python script which segments the hand using Skin Extraction and Background Subtraction, assuming there are no moving objects in the background which resemble skin color (thats the only catch). Tentatively, this project will allow you to create your own hand gesture dataset for your own gesture detection model.
